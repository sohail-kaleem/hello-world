# Salamun Alaikum (Peace be upon you),

This repository doesn't provide any useful software yet but the idea is to leverage Github platform in sharing and contributing to the world with useful software and informative resources that makes our world a better place for all of us.

I believe that being aware isn't going to make the difference. Whereas sharing with communities creates an environment and is the key to prevail.

Github is a good example of such environment, by sharing their platform free with the world has created communities and it is prevailing.
