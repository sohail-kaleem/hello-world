# Salamun Alaikum (Peace be up on you),

This repository doesn't provide any useful software yet but the idea is to leverage Github platform in sharing and contributing to the world with useful software and informative resources that makes our world a better place for all of us.

I beleive that knowing ony builds individuality, whereas sharing builds commnities, and communities create environment and environmets are the key to prevail.

A good example of it is Github itself, because they are sharing their platform free for the world, it has created communities that in turn created an environment that is prevailing.
